# Advent of Code 2025

Goals for this year are to give it a shot in gdscript in Godot game engine.

## gdscript
Based on python but missing many of the basic containers and structures.
There is no set.  The Array is essentially a list.  No deque.  No graph.

# Rules

## Plugins
Outside of GdUnit4 for Unit testing, I don't plan on installing any plugins.

## Build Mode
The project is written up in `Compatibility` mode because it's all text
based and UI-Control nodes.  

## AI Use
AI will not be used for anything other than as a short cut for writing unit tests
against the helper classes I've written myself.
