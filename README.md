Advent of Code


## 2019
Watching some vids in this space and it 
seems that you get to build your own computer.

## 2022
I did Advent of code for this year in a number of different programming languages.
- Rust
- C
- bash
- awk
- perl
- python
- php
- javascript

## 2023
Majority Rust with a tad of python.  

## 2024
Going to attempt all RUST

## 2025
Stretch goal this year as I've completed previous years now a few times.
This year I'm going to do it using the [Godot](https://godotengine.org) game engine.   GDScript has arrays and dictionaries and precious little else for processing.
